# Markdown preview styling

The stylesheet is meant to be used with [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) plug-in. Just replace `none.css` in extension's folder:
`~.vscode\extensions\shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced-0.6.2\node_modules\@shd101wyy\mume\styles\preview_theme` and apply it in settings.

This stylesheet uses `github.css` as a base but without hardcoded colors so they are taken from app's current theme.
